# Adey-Innovations-Fraud-Detection

## Overview

Adey Innovations Inc., a leader in the financial technology sector, is committed to improving fraud detection for e-commerce and banking transactions. The aim of this project is to develop highly accurate fraud detection models using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition, this system will identify fraudulent activities with greater precision, reducing financial losses and increasing trust among customers and financial institutions.

## Key Objectives

The project focuses on enhancing security in e-commerce and bank credit transactions by:

1. **Analyzing and Preprocessing Transaction Data**: Understanding the intricacies of transaction patterns and preparing data for optimal model performance.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identifying key features that are indicative of fraudulent activity through the use of geolocation data and transaction patterns.
3. **Building and Training Machine Learning Models**: Developing and training robust machine learning models specifically tailored to detect fraud in both e-commerce and banking environments.
4. **Model Evaluation and Improvement**: Assessing model performance using relevant metrics and refining the models for increased accuracy.
5. **Deployment and Real-time Monitoring**: Deploying models for real-time fraud detection, establishing systems for ongoing monitoring, and ensuring continuous improvement.
